![Ablation_study](assets/Ablations.png)

*Table-1: Ablation on isolating the MLHW block (with and without TASAB/CAB, and with fixed vs
learnable filters).*

### 2.  Per-image inference latency on GPU

##1. MaHaWave-Net (Ours)     ===> 1.19it/s
##2. VMUNet                  ===> 2.07it/s
##3. UNet                    ===> 2.11it/s
##4. UNet++                  ===> 2.09it/s
